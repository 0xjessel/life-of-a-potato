# Life of a Potato NFTs

Discover the whimsical imagery of a potato's time in Hawaii during COVID. Images drawn by the lovely potato herself.  

This is a Polygon IPFS/Filecoin (via nft.storage) implementation of a NFT collection.  

Huge S/O to Archie Smyth's [tutorial](https://dev.to/yournewempire/deploy-nfts-with-truffle-ipfs-opensea-polygon-5581)!  Also thanks to [Quick Programming](https://medium.com/quick-programming/how-to-deploy-a-smart-contract-with-hardhat-45e0a6ffdb4c) for the HardHat tutorial (wanted to try HardHat instead of truffle this time around).

## Directions

Create your .env file
Get some testnet MATIC 
Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-script.js --network matic_testnet`
Debug Opensea metadata via `https://testnets-api.opensea.io/asset/mumbai/0x324958b2165b4c3f6E7b24e76c782a37AfE6219D/2/validate
